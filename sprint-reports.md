## Sprint #2 (November 7th to November 11th)

5. Web frontend (assigned to Jakob)
6. Figure out how to connect the microphone to the ESP32 (assigned to Aleksander)
7. Figure out how to read values from the microphone (assigned to Julian)
8. Create database schema (assigned to Kacper)
9. Switch to new pooled database library (assigned to Jakob)

### Finished issues

Issues 6, 7, 8, and 9 were finished. Issue #5 is unfinished.

### Retrospective

In this sprint we completed most, but not all, of the issues. This is because issue #5 is quite big. In hindsight, we should have broken it down into smaller issues.
