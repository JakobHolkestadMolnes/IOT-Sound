# Sprint reports

## Sprint #1 (October 18th to November 4th)

### Issues

1. Determine which microphone to use (assigned to Julian)
2. Connect to the MQTT server (assigned to Jakob)
3. Send sensor data to the MQTT server (assigned to Kacper)
4. Save sensor data to a PostgreSQL database (assigned to Jakob)

### Finished issues

All four issues (1, 2, 3, and 4) were completed.

### Retrospective

This sprint went according to plan. We spent the first week planning the project and the following two implementing our plans in code.

## Sprint #2 (November 7th to November 11th)

### Issues

5. Web frontend (assigned to Jakob)
6. Figure out how to connect the microphone to the ESP32 (assigned to Aleksander)
7. Figure out how to read values from the microphone (assigned to Julian)
8. Create database schema (assigned to Kacper)
9. Switch to new pooled database library (assigned to Jakob)

### Finished issues

Issues 6, 7, 8, and 9 were finished. Issue #5 is unfinished.

### Retrospective

In this sprint we completed most, but not all, of the issues. This is because issue #5 is quite big. In hindsight, we should have broken it down into smaller issues.

## Sprint #3 (November 14th to November 25th)

### Issues

10. Display the data on the frontend (assigned to Jakob)
11. Simulate the sensor data (assigned to Kacper)
12. Make the sensor data simulation more natural (assigned to Julian)
13. Start writing the report (assigned to Kacper)
14. Log errors to the database (assigned to Jakob)
15. Display logs on the frontend (assigned to Julian)

### Finished issues

All issues (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15) were completed.

### Retrospective

In this sprint we worked effectively to finish up the project. Although the issues were assigned to only one person, most issues were worked on by two people.
